## Before getting started

Make sure you have the latest version of Go installed on your machine. You can download it from https://golang.org.

You will also need your favorite IDE to write the code. If you have no preferences, I recommend starting with VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

### Note for Windows users

It is also recommended to run it on Mac OS or Linux, so if you are using Windows you might want to enable Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or use a virtual machine like VirtualBox.

WSL setup: https://www.windowscentral.com/install-windows-subsystem-linux-windows-10
VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/

## Create your working environment

You can either:
- Fork this repo to your GitHub profile and then clone it to your machine.
- Create an empty folder on your machine and initialize git locally (`git init`)

Note: If you choose to initialize git locally you may add a remote target at a later stage.

Make sure that the `go` command line application is working as expected:

```sh
$ go version
go version go1.17.4 darwin/arm64
```
